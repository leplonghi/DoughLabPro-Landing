  "faq_title": "Frequently Asked Questions",
  "faq_q1": "What is the difference between Free and Pro?",
  "faq_a1": "Free gives you the essential calculator and basic logging. Pro unlocks the full laboratory: unlimited data, AI diagnostics, advanced fermentation tracking, and cloud sync.",
  "faq_q2": "Why is the app so technical?",
  "faq_a2": "Precision requires detail. We treat dough as a biochemical system. Variables like temperature, protein content, and friction factor matter for consistent results.",
  "faq_q3": "Does it include recipes?",
  "faq_a3": "DoughLabPro is a tool to build and execute recipes, not a cookbook. We provide technical presets for styles, but you are the engineer of the final formula.",
  "faq_q4": "Is my data private?",
  "faq_a4": "Yes. Your MyLab data is yours. We do not sell your recipes or usage data to third parties.",
  "faq_q5": "Can I cancel Pro anytime?",
  "faq_a5": "Absolutely. Management is done directly through your app store subscription settings.",
  "faq_q6": "Does it support metric and imperial?",
  "faq_a6": "Yes. The calculator converts seamlessly between Grams, Kilograms, Ounces and Pounds, though we strongly recommend metric for precision.",
  "faq_q7": "What is Levain Pet?",
  "faq_a7": "It is a dedicated module to track the microbiome health of your starter based on feeding ratios, temperature, and rise times.",
